Category App

This app is responsible for managing book categories in the bookstore API.
It allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on categories.
The app supports a flat hierarchy for categories,
where each category has a unique name and a list of books assigned to it.
Categories play a crucial role in organizing the bookstore's inventory and providing filtering options for users.
The app is designed to efficiently manage and retrieve categories for a large number of books.
